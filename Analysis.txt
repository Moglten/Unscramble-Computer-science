hi there.. i wish my analysis find u will 

for task0:-

i using indexing in Python as i know indexing doesnt take any steps
so Complixety of it is (O(1)) fixed time .

for task1:-

i used mathematical way to achieve the number that duplicates using set
and set take to convert O(n) and mathematical notation for simple value take O(1)
so over all the program take (O(n)).

for task2:-

i used for loop iterates over all number i have so taking O(n) 
and max in my dict to get maximum value take O(n)
that mean the program takes (O(n)).

for task3:-

for task3 all i used is looping and no nested one so that take (O(n)).

for task4:-

and here is O(n) else.



and Thank You ^_^.
